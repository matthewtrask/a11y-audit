# a11y-audit
To setup basic accessibility audits

## Some things to consider

* Need a form to submit information to make it easier to log things - maybe?
* Flow of adding project/managing projects may be improved
* Issue label colors: Used one color for all Level A, a second color for all Level AA, and a third color with all Level AAA. **I'm not married to this concept, nor to these specific colors.**
